# Design Docs

This folder contains open design docs.
If you want to provide a new feature or change a behavior in the operator that requires large or risky changes please create a design doc for it.
We have a design doc [template](template.md) that must be used for creating a new design doc.
All implemented design docs are saved in [implemented](implemented).
