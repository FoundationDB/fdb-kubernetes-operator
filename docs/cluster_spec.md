## AutomaticReplacementOptions

AutomaticReplacementOptions controls options for automatically replacing failed processes.

| Field | Description | Scheme | Required |
| ----- | ----------- | ------ | -------- |
| enabled | Enabled controls whether automatic replacements are enabled. The default is false. | *bool | false |
| failureDetectionTimeSeconds | FailureDetectionTimeSeconds controls how long a process must be failed or missing before it is automatically replaced. The default is 7200 seconds, or 2 hours. | *int | false |
| taintReplacementTimeSeconds | TaintReplacementTimeSeconds controls how long a pod stays in NodeTaintReplacing condition before it is automatically replaced. The default is 1800 seconds, i.e., 30min | *int | false |
| maxConcurrentReplacements | MaxConcurrentReplacements controls how many automatic replacements are allowed to take part. This will take the list of current replacements and then calculate the difference between maxConcurrentReplacements and the size of the list. e.g. if currently 3 replacements are queued (e.g. in the processGroupsToRemove list) and maxConcurrentReplacements is 5 the operator is allowed to replace at most 2 process groups. Setting this to 0 will basically disable the automatic replacements. | *int | false |
| taintReplacementOptions | TaintReplacementOption controls which taint label the operator will react to. | [][TaintReplacementOption](#taintreplacementoption) | false |

| emptyMonitorConf | EmptyMonitorConf instructs the operator to update all of the fdbmonitor.conf files to have zero fdbserver processes configured. | bool | false |
| ignoreDuringRestart | IgnoreDuringRestart instructs the operator to ignore the provided process groups IDs during the restart command. This can be useful to simulate cases where the kill command is not restarting all processes. IgnoreDuringRestart does not support the wildcard option to ignore all of this specific cluster processes. | [][ProcessGroupID](#processgroupid) | false |
| blockRemoval | BlockRemoval defines a list of process group IDs that will not be removed, even if they are marked for removal. The operator will trigger the exclusion but the removal of the resources will be blocked until they are removed from this list. This setting can be used to simulate cases where a process group is marked for removal but the resources are not yet removed. | [][ProcessGroupID](#processgroupid) | false |

| ----- | ----------- | ------ | -------- |
| configureDatabase | ConfigureDatabase defines whether the operator is allowed to reconfigure the database. | *bool | false |
| killProcesses | KillProcesses defines whether the operator is allowed to bounce fdbserver processes. | *bool | false |
| cacheDatabaseStatusForReconciliation | CacheDatabaseStatusForReconciliation defines whether the operator is using the same FoundationDB machine-readable status for all sub-reconcilers or if the machine-readable status should be fetched by ever sub-reconciler if required. Enabling this setting might improve the operator reconciliation speed for large clusters. | *bool | false |
| replacements | Replacements contains options for automatically replacing failed processes. | [AutomaticReplacementOptions](#automaticreplacementoptions) | false |
| ignorePendingPodsDuration | IgnorePendingPodsDuration defines how long a Pod has to be in the Pending Phase before ignore it during reconciliation. This prevents Pod that are stuck in Pending to block further reconciliation. | time.Duration | false |
| useNonBlockingExcludes | UseNonBlockingExcludes defines whether the operator is allowed to use non blocking exclude commands. The default is false. | *bool | false |
| useLocalitiesForExclusion | UseLocalitiesForExclusion defines whether the exclusions are done using localities instead of IP addresses. The default is false. | *bool | false |
| ignoreTerminatingPodsSeconds | IgnoreTerminatingPodsSeconds defines how long a Pod has to be in the Terminating Phase before we ignore it during reconciliation. This prevents Pod that are stuck in Terminating to block further reconciliation. | *int | false |
| ignoreMissingProcessesSeconds | IgnoreMissingProcessesSeconds defines how long a process group has to be in the MissingProcess condition until it will be ignored during reconciliation. This prevents that a process will block reconciliation. | *int | false |
| failedPodDurationSeconds | FailedPodDurationSeconds defines the duration a Pod can stay in the deleted state (deletionTimestamp != 0) before it gets marked as PodFailed. This is important in cases where a fdbserver process is still reporting but the Pod resource is marked for deletion. This can happen when the kubelet or a node fails. Setting this condition will ensure that the operator is replacing affected Pods. | *int | false |
| maxConcurrentReplacements | MaxConcurrentReplacements defines how many process groups can be concurrently replaced if they are misconfigured. If the value will be set to 0 this will block replacements and these misconfigured Pods must be replaced manually or by another process. For each reconcile loop the operator calculates the maximum number of possible replacements by taken this value as the upper limit and removes all ongoing replacements that have not finished. Which means if the value is set to 5 and we have 4 ongoing replacements (process groups marked with remove but not excluded) the operator is allowed to replace on further process group. | *int | false |
| deletionMode | DeletionMode defines the deletion mode for this cluster. This can be PodUpdateModeNone, PodUpdateModeAll, PodUpdateModeZone or PodUpdateModeProcessGroup. The DeletionMode defines how Pods are deleted in order to update them or when they are removed. | [PodUpdateMode](#podupdatemode) | false |
| removalMode | RemovalMode defines the removal mode for this cluster. This can be PodUpdateModeNone, PodUpdateModeAll, PodUpdateModeZone or PodUpdateModeProcessGroup. The RemovalMode defines how process groups are deleted in order when they are marked for removal. | [PodUpdateMode](#podupdatemode) | false |
| waitBetweenRemovalsSeconds | WaitBetweenRemovalsSeconds defines how long to wait between the last removal and the next removal. This is only an upper limit if the process group and the according resources are deleted faster than the provided duration the operator will move on with the next removal. The idea is to prevent a race condition were the operator deletes a resource but the Kubernetes API is slower to trigger the actual deletion, and we are running into a situation where the fault tolerance check still includes the already deleted processes. Defaults to 60. | *int | false |
| podUpdateStrategy | PodUpdateStrategy defines how Pod spec changes are rolled out either by replacing Pods or by deleting Pods. The default for this is ReplaceTransactionSystem. | [PodUpdateStrategy](#podupdatestrategy) | false |
| useManagementAPI | UseManagementAPI defines if the operator should make use of the management API instead of using fdbcli to interact with the FoundationDB cluster. | *bool | false |
| maintenanceModeOptions | MaintenanceModeOptions contains options for maintenance mode related settings. | [MaintenanceModeOptions](#maintenancemodeoptions) | false |
| ignoreLogGroupsForUpgrade | IgnoreLogGroupsForUpgrade defines the list of LogGroups that should be ignored during fdb version upgrade. The default is a list that includes \"fdb-kubernetes-operator\". | [][LogGroup](#loggroup) | false |

## RoutingConfig

RoutingConfig allows configuring routing to our pods, and services that sit in front of them.

| Field | Description | Scheme | Required |
| ----- | ----------- | ------ | -------- |
| headlessService | Headless determines whether we want to run a headless service for the cluster. | *bool | false |
| publicIPSource | PublicIPSource specifies what source a process should use to get its public IPs.  This supports the values `pod` and `service`. | *[PublicIPSource](#publicipsource) | false |
| podIPFamily | PodIPFamily tells the pod which family of IP addresses to use. You can use 4 to represent IPv4, and 6 to represent IPv6. This feature is only supported in FDB 7.0 or later, and requires dual-stack support in your Kubernetes environment. | *int | false |
| useDNSInClusterFile | UseDNSInClusterFile determines whether to use DNS names rather than IP addresses to identify coordinators in the cluster file. NOTE: This is an experimental feature, and is not supported in the latest stable version of FoundationDB. | *bool | false |
| defineDNSLocalityFields | DefineDNSLocalityFields determines whether to define pod DNS names on pod specs and provide them in the locality arguments to fdbserver.  This is ignored if UseDNSInCluster is true. | *bool | false |
| dnsDomain | DNSDomain defines the cluster domain used in a DNS name generated for a service. The default is `cluster.local`. | *string | false |

## TaintReplacementOption

TaintReplacementOption defines the taint key and taint duration the operator will react to a tainted node Example of TaintReplacementOption   - key: \"example.org/maintenance\"     durationInSeconds: 7200 # Ensure the taint is present for at least 2 hours before replacing Pods on a node with this taint.   - key: \"*\" # The wildcard would allow to define a catch all configuration     durationInSeconds: 3600 # Ensure the taint is present for at least 1 hour before replacing Pods on a node with this taint  Setting durationInSeconds to the maximum of int64 will practically disable the taint key. When a Node taint key matches both an exact TaintReplacementOption key and a wildcard key, the exact matched key will be used.

| Field | Description | Scheme | Required |
| ----- | ----------- | ------ | -------- |
| key | Tainted key | *string | false |
| durationInSeconds | The tainted key must be present for DurationInSeconds before operator replaces pods on the node with this taint; DurationInSeconds cannot be a negative number. | *int64 | false |

## ProcessCounts

ProcessCounts represents the number of processes we have for each valid process class.  If one of the counts in the spec is set to 0, we will infer the process count for that class from the role counts. If one of the counts in the spec is set to -1, we will not create any processes for that class. See GetProcessCountsWithDefaults for more information on the rules for inferring process counts.

## ImageConfig

ImageConfig provides a policy for customizing an image.  When multiple image configs are provided, they will be merged into a single config that will be used to define the final image. For each field, we select the value from the first entry in the config list that defines a value for that field, and matches the version of FoundationDB the image is for. Any config that specifies a different version than the one under consideration will be ignored for the purposes of defining that image.

| Field | Description | Scheme | Required |
