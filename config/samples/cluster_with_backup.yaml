# This file provides an example of a cluster with a backup running.
#
# The backup resource will bring up backup agents and start a backup. Once it
# is reconciled, you can run backup commands from the backup agent containers:
#
#     # Check Status
#     kubectl exec deployment/sample-cluster-backup-agents -- fdbbackup status
#
#     # List Backups
#     kubectl exec deployment/sample-cluster-backup-agents -- fdbbackup list -b "blobstore://minio@minio-service:9000?bucket=fdb-backups"
#
# This example uses configuration for a local MinIO instance, which is set up as
# part of the local testing environment for the operator. This instance has
# certificates stored in Kubernetes secrets, and credentials that are hardcoded
# in the YAML. This configuration is for testing purposes only. You will need to
# determine the appropriate way of managing certificates and credentials for
# your real environment and endpoints, as well as the appropriate backup
# solution to use. We use MinIO in our local tests due to its lightweight setup,
# but you can backup to any S3-compatible object storage service.
#
# If you are testing this in Docker Desktop, you can browse the local MinIO
# instance at https://localhost:9000. Note: This will use a certificate that
# is not in your browser's trust store, so you will get a security warning.
