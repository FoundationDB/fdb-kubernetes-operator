# This file provides an example of a cluster with backup agents running
# alongside the cluster.
#
# Once the cluster and the backup agents are up, you can start a backup by
# opening a shell one of the backup_agent pods and running the
# `fdbbackup start` command.
#
# Note that this example contains placeholders for secrets. You will need to
# fill in those placeholders with real values for your backup destination to
# do a secure backup.
