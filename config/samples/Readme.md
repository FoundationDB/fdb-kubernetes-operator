# Samples

This folder contains some samples on how to use the FoundationDB operator.
All files except for `pod_disruption_budget.yaml` are automatically generated from the [config/tests](../tests) folder.
If you want to change the base files, do the changes in the `config/tests` folder and then run `make samples`.
You can find some additional examples under `config/tests`.
